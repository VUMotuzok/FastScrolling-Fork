# Fast-Scrolling #
**Fast-Scrolling** is a small IntelliJ-Plugin, that allows you to scroll up and down faster in a big file in IntelliJ IDEA, by holding a configurable key (the default key is *[CTRL]*) and moving the mouse wheel.
    
Fast-Scrolling is inspired by the scrolling behavior of Eclipse.
